`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

This NIP defines `kind:30818` (a _parameterized replaceable event_) for long-form text content similar to [NIP-23](23.md), but with one important difference: articles are meant to be descriptions, or encyclopedia entries, of particular subjects, and it's expected that multiple people will write articles about the exact same subjects, with either small variations or completely independent content.

Articles are identified by lowercase, normalized ascii `d` tags.

[INSERT NORMALIZATION EXAMPLES]

The content should be Markdown, following the same rules as of [NIP-23](23.md), although it only takes 2 extra (optional) metadata tags:

  - `title`: for when the display title should be different from the `d` tag.
  - `summary`: for display in lists.

One extra functionality is added: **wikilinks**. Unlike normal Markdown links `[]()` that link to webpages, wikilinks `[[]]` link to other articles in the wiki. In this case, the wiki is the entirety of Nostr. Clicking on a wikilink should cause the client to ask relays for events with `d` tags equal to the target of that wikilink.

Event `kind:30819` is also defined to stand for "wiki redirects", i.e. if one thinks `Shell structure` should redirect to `Thin-shell structure` they can issue one of these events instead of replicating the content. These events can be used for automatically redirecting between articles on a client, but also for generating crowdsourced "disambiguation" pages ([common in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Disambiguation)).

How to decide what article to display
-------------------------------------

As there could be many articles for each given name, some kind of prioritization must be done by clients. Criteria for this should vary between users and clients, but some means that can be used are described below:

### Reactions

[NIP-25](25.md) reactions are very simple and can be used to create a simple web-of-trust between wiki article writers and their content. While just counting a raw number of "likes" is unproductive, reacting to any wiki article event with a `+` can be interpreted as a recommendation for that article specifically and a partial recommendation of the author of that article. When 2 or 3-level deep recommendations are followed, suddenly a big part of all the articles may have some form of tagging.

### Relays

[NIP-51](51.md) lists of relays can be created with the kind 10102 and then used by wiki clients in order to determine where to query articles first and to rank these differently in relation to other events fetched from other relays.

### Contact lists

[NIP-02](02.md) contact lists can form the basis of a recommendation system that is then expanded with relay lists and reaction lists through nested queries. These lists form a good starting point only because they are so widespread.

### Wiki-related contact lists

[NIP-51](51.md) lists can also be used to create a list of users that are trusted only in the context of wiki authorship or wiki curationship.
